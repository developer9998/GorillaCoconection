### Usage

<b>NOTE: This mod is incomplete. I'm still trying to piece this together, as I'm aware name tags aren't made sometimes.</b>

The mod can be useful in various ways, but the most common method is knowing the player who played down a stray coconut, so you can yell at them about it. 

Well, I'm obviously exaggerating about that last point. If you couldn't tell. Don't leave your coconut camera behind next time.
